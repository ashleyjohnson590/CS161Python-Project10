missing required docstring for init method
-1 / 0 pts
Correctly used an init method to set up board, sets each position to be empty, sets the current state to “UNFINISHED”, and sets whose turn it is. (This last one might be done in initial_placement, but something to hold the turn state should be in the class.)

Comments
make_move method does change the "turn" at the end of a move, but it does not test that it is that player's turn before the move is made. There is an 'else' branch that returns False if it's not that player's turn, but it will never be reached. The current turn should be tested first, instead of at the end.
